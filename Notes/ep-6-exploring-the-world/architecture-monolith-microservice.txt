Monolith: 
-> we used to have a huge big project
-> this project have apis, ui, authentication, db connection, messaging logic
-> so even if a single minor change was done, the whole project needed to be deployed again

Microservice Architecture: 
(Seperation of concerns / Single Responsibility Principle)
(where each service has its own job)

-> we have different services for different jobs
* backend apis
* UI services
* notification project
* authentication

-> we can have different services written in different tech stack
-> all big companies have multiple techstack
-> all ms are deployed on different ports

-> how do these services interact with each other?
