React:
All the browsers have js engine in it, but they do not understand the react code

CDN:
a distributed network of servers located in various geographic locations around the world
main purpose of a CDN is to deliver content to users with high performance and availability.
getting react from cdn is not a good way 
as it makes a network call and make our app launching slower
using it via package.json is preferred as it will take care of the version too
