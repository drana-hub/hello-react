Reconciliation Algorithm / React Fiber:
-> this new algorithm came out in React 16 and since then it is known as react Fiber

React creates a 
virtual DOM of the UI (an representation of actual DOM)

Since all { re = React.createElements() } react elemets are objects
All objects in these are called Virtual DOMS

So Virtual DOM is an object representation of the actual DOM


DOM is like a tree


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Diff Algorithm:
It finds out the difference between two virtual DOMs 
(the updated virtual dom and the previous virtual dom)
