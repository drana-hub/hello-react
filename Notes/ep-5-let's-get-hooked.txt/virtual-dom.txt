Diffing Algorithm:
-> Finding out the diference b/w 2 HTML nodes is tough
-> but finding out the diff b/w 2 js objects is fast


Virtual Dom: the object representation of this dom tree
React does not touch the actual DOM a lot
i.e. why react is fast
whenever there is any change in state variable


React application has one virtual DOM tree that represents the entire UI, 
and each component in the application corresponds to a subtree within that virtual DOM tree.


* Incremental rendering

Q- why is react fast?
bcz it is doing efficient dom manipulation with the help of diff algorithm
react keeps an eye on state variables (constantly checking them )

Virtual Dom as a concept existed long before react (JS representation of HTML DOM Tree )
but react used it first
