react is fast/ efficient in Dom-manipulation
if we have to keep our data and UI layer consistent to each other, that is where all frameworks come in picture
if my data changes, my Ui should update accordingnly
so react is fast bcz it can do faster/efficient DOM manipulation
virtual Dom - diff algorithm - reconciliation

to bind the data to the UI, react gives us superpower


2 very imp hooks - useState, useEffect (99%)
useState gives super powerful state variables in react
it is a named import from react
it is used to create a state variable, i.e, a variable which can handle state of our app


superpowerful variable, i.e, a state variable in react
  to create a state variable , we use hooks in react, i.e, useState hook

  useState(defaultVAlue) of the state variable
  since the way of creating a state variable is a different,
  way of modifing it will also be different
  set function is not mandatory to be given


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Most Important concept
Note: whenever a state variable updates, react re-renders the components
this is the power of react

Q- What are hooks in react?
-> a hook is a normal js function given to us by react
-> that function is a utility function written by fb developers

By efficiently updating only the necessary parts of the UI, 
React provides a performance optimization, 
ensuring that the user interface remains responsive and avoids unnecessary re-renders and updates.

This is why react is most popular library for building UI applications
-> React makes this DOM operation super-fast and efficient
-> the logic of re-rendering the component is what makes react super-fast as soon as any of the state variable changes
