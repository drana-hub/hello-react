Props: short-form of property
-> If we want to pass data dynamically to a component , we can pass it via props
-> they are just normal arguments to a function
-> passing props is just like passing argumnets to a function

-> when we build production-ready apps, we have to write production ready app

-> not using keys (not acceptable)

Q- Why is Key required as a prop?
-> bcz if all the alike components get the unique id, 
-> if there will be a unique key, react will only re-render that particular part instead of all the components
-> it's a huge optimization in react

React index as key:
-> its okay to use index as a key but not recommended
-> React does not recommend using index as a key

Syntactic Sugar: 
{[<ResCard key={2} resName={2} />]}
{<ResCard key={2} resName={2} />}

Both the above lines render the same thing as
JSX allows direct rendering of components without an enclosing array or fragment

Q- why index as a key is not recommended?
