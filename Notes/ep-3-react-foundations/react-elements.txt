* React Element: Not a html element, it is actually an object
React Element => Object => everything in js is an object
const heading = React.createElement(
    "h1",
    { id: "heading" },
    "Namaste Bhai log"
);
core react will create this element
when react was built, 
react devs realized it was not a very dev friendly syntax to create browser elements

* Root: 
-> root is also an object in itself
first we create root, the entry point of our react application
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
we provide an object to root.render


* root.render(heading);
when we render this object on DOM it becomes an html element
so this js object is rendered as an html element
whatever which happens in react will happen inside this root

* ReactDOM
we need ReactDOM for displaying the elements on browser



{
  /* <div id = 'par'>
    <h1> hey </h1>
    <h2> hello </h2>
</div> */
}

 const h = React.createElement("div", { id: 'par' },
     [React.createElement("h1", { key: 'sa' }, 'Hello from React!'),
     React.createElement("h2", { key: 'ye' }, 'heya')]
 );
 console.log(h)
