* npx:
npx: means executing a package
NPX comes bundled with NPM version 5.2+
major advantage of npx is the ability to execute a package 
which wasn't previously installed: like npx create-react-app

-> npx parcel index.html
it has created a server for us and hosted our app on localhost:1234
when we use npx parcel , it generates the dev build and put it in dist folder
.parcel-cache and dist folder are automatically generated while making the build


->npx parcel build index.html
prod builds take slighly more time as they require more Optimization
prod build is highly optimized


# Parcel
- Dev Build (Builds different bundles for dev and prod)
- Local Server
- HMR: Hot Module replacement with File watching algorithm in c++
- Caching (Faster Buils)
- Image Optimization
- Minfication
- Bundling
- Compressing
- Consistent Hashing
- Code Splittting
- Differential Bundling (So that app runs smoothly on older browsers)
- Diagnostic
- Tree Shaking (Remove unused code for us/unused functions)

* bundler:
the most imp package in our app is a bundler eg: webpack, parcel, veet
it cleans, minifies, optimizes, bundles and packages our code so that it can be sent to prod
create-react-app behind the scene uses webpack and babel behind the scenes

* parcel :
it will give so much power to our app, it can host our app on server
it built a development build for our app
it created a server, hosted our app on it with source file
parcel uses babel

* babel :
Babel is a free and open-source JavaScript transcompiler that is mainly used 
to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into backwards-compatible JavaScript code 
that can be run by older JavaScript engines

* HMR: Hot Module Replacement
Parcel does hot module replacement with the help of file watching algorithm - written in c++
It caches things for us to go us faster builds
